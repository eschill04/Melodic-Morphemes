Hate to give the satisfaction asking how you're doing now
How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about?
Just what you wanted
Look at you, cool guy, you got it
I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes
Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise
I loved you truly
You gotta laugh at the stupidity

[Chorus]
'Cause I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naive
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, fame fucker
Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire
[Verse 2]
And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news
You called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called 'em crazy too
You're so convincing
How do you lie without flinching? (How do you lie? How do you lie? How do you lie?)
Oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill
Can't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will
Went for me and not her
'Cause girls your age know better

[Bridge]
(Ah)
You said it was true love, but wouldn't that be hard?
You can't love anyone 'cause that would mean you had a heart
I tried to help you out, now I know that I can't
'Cause how you think's the kind of thing I'll never understand

Used to pray for rain just to stay inside
You wouldn't believe it, every move I made, I was terrified
Thought that every road I took had a bitter end
I just couldn't see it, I convinced myself tryna trust again
Would be like tryna make a river run upstream
Tryna make a mountain into a valley
That's what your love does to me
You make me feel

Like I never had my heart broken
Like I never saw a door closin'
Like I never watched love run away on fire
In the night like a pack of wild horses
Like I never felt the tears rollin'

Never did the thought ever cross
And never did I think I would stop
Forever, no one tells you the cost
Of paradise, paradise
Kisses, but they cut like a knife
I wish this was a little more right
Once sweet words, now they come with a bite
Oh, hungry eyes, hungry eyes

Sleazin' and teasin', I'm sittin' on him
All of my diamonds are drippin' on him
I met him at the bar, it was twelve or something
I ordered two more wines 'cause tonight, I want him

[Verse 1: RAYE]
A little context if you care to listen
I find myself in a shit position
The man that I love sat me down last night
And he told me that it's over, dumb decision
And I don't wanna feel how my heart is rippin'
In fact, I don't wanna feel, so I stick to sippin'
And I'm out on the town with a simple mission
In my little black dress and this shit is sittin'

[Pre-Chorus: RAYE]
Just a heart broke bitch, high heels six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi sniffin' cocaine
Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex
I was lookin' for a man who was on the same page
Now it's back to the intro, back to the bar
To the Bentley, to the hotel, to my old ways

[Verse 2: RAYE & 070 Shake]
Toke this joint how I'm blowin' this steam
Back to my ways like 2019
Not twenty-four hours since my ex did dead it
I got a new man on me, it's about to get sweaty
Last night really was the cherry on the cake
Been some dark days lately and I'm findin' it cripplin'
Excuse my state, I'm as high as your hopes
That you'll make it to my bed, get me hot and sizzlin'
If I take a step back to see the glass half-full
At least it's the Prada two-piece that I'm trippin' in
And I'm already actin' like a dick, know what I mean?
So you might as well stick it in (What?)

Take a look inside your heart, is there any room for me?
I won't have to hold my breath till you get down on one knee
Because you only want to hold me when I'm looking good enough
Did you ever feel me? Would you ever picture us?
Every time I pull my hair, well, it's only out of fear
That you'll find me ugly and one day you'll disappear because
What's the point of crying? It was never even love
Did you ever want me? Was I ever good enough?

Well, I guess the third time's not a charm
Nursing a three times broken heart
I'm down the rabbit hole again
I put myself in another world
Where I can be any other girl
'Cause I don't really wanna face it

[Pre-Chorus]

It's all you'll ever need

But it hurts a lot less to me

I fall in love with boys I see on a TV screen
The ones in books who are as perfect as they can be
I spend all of my time imagining what it would be like if they existed
My parents tell me I should look for one in real life
But I get let down by both the bad boys and the nice guys
I'm tired of giving more than I receive
So, I'll just stick to the boys who don't know me

Oh, I hit his number, I almost called
Like, maybe he's hurting after all

Just like our daddy
He kick-started that bike one night and broke mama's heart
He pointed that headlight West, out where the wild things are

He'd call me up every couple of weeks
From South California
Talk about the desert and the Joshua Tree
And his pretty girl stories
And how he bought an Airstream trailer and a J-45 guitar
Said, ""Little brother, you'd love it out here, out where the wild things are""

Oh, oh-oh, the nights ignite like gasoline
And light up those streets that never sleep when the sky goes dark

The second I made it
We started drinkin' on the strip in L.A
And then it got crazy
Ended up at a house in the hills with some Hollywood stars
Kissin' on a blonde in a backyard pool, out where the wild things are

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision

Heading South,Zach Bryan,Country,"8 ContributorsHeading South Lyrics[Verse 1]
Was a boy who was a dreamer and he flew so high and proud
In a world full of people out to cut his young ass down
No one ever understood a single word he said
And they cast him to the wolves when he wasn’t well and fed

[Verse 2]
Boys we’ve got a riser, a riser in our midst
He will get the last laugh if it’s the last thing he did
And he used to roll around in that red dirt mud
But now he’s skipping town and that riser's out for blood

[Chorus]
Don’t stop goin’, goin’ south
'Cause they’ll let you play your music real damn loud
Don’t stop headin’, headin’ south
'Cause they will understand thе words that are pouring from your mouth

[Verse 3]
Then that boy he callеd his daddy to tell him what he did
As the masses scream the lyrics of a messed up kid
And then he told that old man he was never comin' back
To be cut down again in a town like that

[Bridge]
Then he surely came to learn people come to watch you fall
He's out to make a name and a fool out of ‘em all
And they’ll never understand that boy and his kind
All they comprehend is a fuckin' dollar sign

Sunday morning
Man, she woke up fightin' mad
Bitchin' and moanin' on and on
'Bout the time I had
And by Tuesday you could say
That girl was good as gone
Then when Thursday came around I was all alone
So I went for a drive to clear my mind
Ended up at a Shell on I-65

[Chorus 1]
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
I bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours

[Verse 2]
Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
When she heard about my newfound luck
On that FM dial
And it's crazy how lately now
It just seems to come in waves
What I thought was gonna be the death of me
Was my saving grace

And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart

Pretty Little Poison,Warren Zeiders,Country,"9 ContributorsPretty Little Poison Lyrics[Verse 1]
Every night, 'round about this time
It's like she knows I'm lonely
Rolls up when the wine is gone
Like a record on repeat
Leanin' on old memories
And talkin' 'bout what used to be
She'll probably be the death of me
But damn if it ain't sweet

[Chorus]
She's my pretty little poison
My heartache in the night
With a kiss on her lips just like cyanide
Yeah, she came with a warnin'
But I didn't mind
I'll go out on that high every time
She's my pretty little poison
My pretty littlе poison

[Verse 2]
Shadows dancin' down the hall
Whispers that she wants mе
Try my best not to fall
When she falls into me
We all need some kind of fix
For me, she's the one I'll pick
Nothin' else will do the trick
She's all I need

Before He Cheats,Carrie Underwood,Country,"70 ContributorsBefore He Cheats Lyrics[Verse 1]
Right now, he's probably slow dancing
With a bleached-blonde tramp
And she's probably getting frisky
Right now, he's probably buying her some fruity little drink
'Cause she can't shoot a whiskey
Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool-stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know

[Chorus]
I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville Slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

[Verse 2]
Right now, she's probably up singing some
White-trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now, she's probably saying, ""I'm drunk""
And he's a thinking that he's gonna get lucky

Girl, I meant what I said

Baby, a little too soon

He can have this house, everything inside

But what he'll never have is the love I have for you

Just before the summer disappeared
We went a-ridin' them old farm ruts
Hangin' out on the gate of his truck
We threw a blanket 'neath the sunset
Bein' brave as eighteen gets
We gave each other more than our hearts
With the help of a mason jar

Or that first sip of a cold beer when the working week's done
I love the twilight in the morning 'fore the day wakes up
With the windows down on the first ride in a paid-up truck
And I love a slow down in a beach town with an ocean view
And I love a first fall Saturday trip down to Baton Rouge
And I love a six-string with the stars out and the campfire glow
But girl, that don't even come close

The way that you dance when you get kinda tipsy
I'm wrapped 'round your finger like this ring I'm wearin'

And I don't even know what it is, but now that I found it

And we're, we're just getting started

And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound of you sayin' ""don't go""

And everyday I grow more and more impatient
While you keep me waiting

Waiting for your call
But you never call
If I didn't know different
I'd think you didn't care at all
You said you'd meet me halfway
But I know you won't
And more than not these days
I feel this way

But, these four walls keep me company
They don't ask for much
Don't just up and leave
These four walls
I've got these four walls
Even when you don't call

Trying to find the words to say
It's kind of like walking through mines
'Cause we were born on different planets
But you would love it back at minе
Afraid to shoot again
'Cause if I miss
But I try, I try, I try

Crazy
If I had a penny for all the times a man nearly made me crazy (Huh)
Well, heck I'd be a millionaire by now
Maybe even as early as a baby
From the classroom to the break time
Kiss Chase in the playground
Hoping that he picks me in
Heads Down, Thumbs Up
He don't show no love
It don't change when you grow up
Just physical, still no love

[Pre-Chorus: Mahalia]
Men will always love the chase, yeah
They still wanna kiss you and then run away (Kiss you and run away)
Ain't nothing changed if it's always the same
Then it can't bе me to blame

I'm going back to the start
Through the darkness of my body parts
Oh Lord, there is horror in my bones
I'm gonna swim in the sin
And down the river of lost innocence
Oh Lord, spit me out into the ocean's arms

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm going back to my heart

I'm gonna float down the throat
With every word I have misspoke
There are some folks I have tortured with my voice
I'm gonna chase down the brain
With every thought I wish I didn't think
And tell 'em, ""You're not wrong, you're just in pain""

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm going back to my heart today

Model house life meltdown still a modern dream letdown, it kills me
You know I'm dying out here

We were a hammer to the Statue of David
We were a painting you could never frame, and
You were the sunshine of my lifetime
What would you trade the pain for?

This city always hangs a little bit lonely on me, loose
Like a kid playing pretend in his father's suit
I'd never go, I just want to be invited, oh, got to give up
Get the feeling, get the feeling, don't fight it, fight it

Sending my love from the other side of the apocalypse
And I just about snapped, don't look back

Summer falling through our fingers again
And you were the sunshine of my lifetime

Not gonna go home

Hand on my cold shoulder

And my daddy always taught me to say
